# Script to create randomly subsampled fastq files from an original for a list of different sampling rates
# Usage- change sample_rates array to whatever you want to subsample to then run the following command in terminal:
# ./1_coarseSubsamplingScript.sh <fast_q file> <output_dir (eg. ./output)>
# **Make sure bbmap is installed in the current conda environment**
